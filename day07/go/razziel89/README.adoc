== Day 07: The Treachery of Whales ==

This is my implementation for both rounds of the whales puzzle.

=== Oveview ===

This solution contains a `solution.go`, which defines the main executable.
There is also a `utils.go`, which is currently where some helper functions are.
This solution also re-uses the counting set implementation of day 3 in
`set.go` but using integers instead of string tokens this time.

`solution.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::solution.go[tags=solution]
----

`utils.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::utils.go[tags=utils]
----

`set.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::set.go[tags=set]
----

There are currently no tests.

=== How to run ===

Assuming the required input is in a file `input.dat`, you only need to execute
`cat input.dat | go run .` to run the solution for both parts.
The solution for part 1 will be output first, followed by that for part 2.
